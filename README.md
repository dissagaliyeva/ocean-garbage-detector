### About
There are three things I like the most: animals, programming, and quick results. I was thinking for quite some time which project to go with to put those three ideas together to explore Computer Vision & Deep Learning. One day, I was scrolling through Instagram and saw a new post by the OceanCleanUp where they shared their results within the five months of their mission. That got me thinking, "What can I do? Is it something to explore further?". I saw how they're using weight estimation, distance measurement, and other stuffs, and I was like "hey, that's Computer Vision!". After some research, I came across a fact that cigarette butts is the most common litter that goes to water. That's how the project idea came to life. <br>

**To-do**:
[x] Download & annotate images 
[x] Fine-tune DETR model
[x] Detect and summarize items (images)
[] Detect and summarize items (videos)
[] Go with bigger garbage: estimate distance 
[] Go with bigger garbage: estimate weight
